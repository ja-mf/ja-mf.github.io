	 Currently, I'm doing an MSc. on Electrical Engineering at <a href="http://www.usm.cl">UTFSM</a>, where
	 my research is centered on biomedical applications of statistical machine learning. I like mathematics, all kinds of art and psychology. I think life is an absurd, and that is not a bad fact.<br/>
	 I have a background on information security and cryptography, as well I have worked as a full stack developer in several languages and as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysadmin">Sysadmin</a> at the same university.<br/>
