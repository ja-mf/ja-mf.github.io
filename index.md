 Currently, I'm doing an MSc on Electrical Engineering at <a href="http://www.usm.cl">UTFSM</a>, where
 my research is centered on developing adaptive filtering techniques for clinical psychopathology assesment. It's
 kind of specific but I'm mostly interested in the intersection of mathematics, music and psychology. That leaded me
 naturally to neuroscience, after I completed a bachelor's degree on Telematics engineering, where I worked as a
 research assistant on cryptography.

I have a background on information security and cryptography, as well I have worked as a full stack developer in several languages and as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysadmin">Sysadmin</a> at the same university.

  I think life is an absurd, and that is not a bad fact. I think that most of the things in which I have been considered
  meticulous, "competent" or "skilled" were motivated by pure and free curiosity.
