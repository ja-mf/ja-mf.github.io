### &mdash; 
what you see is what you want to see  
&nbsp;but what you want is not revealed to you fairly easily  
&nbsp;and when it does, it is just an illussion,  
&nbsp;as the same glimpse of certainty that came up  
an irreproducible road  
that vanishes to desire  
again  

ghosts moves only when you are not watching  

### &mdash;
intention  
is the ephemeral moment  
when someone is sat on a toilet  
&nbsp; pants down, genitals over water  
is asked if is willing to take a shit  
and answers:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; yes.  

intention  
is the sustained moment  
when someone is sat on a toilet  
 &nbsp;naked  
is asked if is willing to take a shit  
and answers:  
&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to shake your hand
