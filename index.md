### &mdash; 
what you see is what you want to see  
&nbsp;but what you want is not revealed to you quite easily
&nbsp;and when it does, it is just an illusion,  
&nbsp;as the same glimpse of certainty that came up  
an irreproducible road  
that vanishes to desire  
again  

ghosts moves only when you are not watching
